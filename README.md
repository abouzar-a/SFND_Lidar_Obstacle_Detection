# Lidar Obstacle Detection Project
## Sensor Fusion Nanodegree Program

![Lidar Stream][image1]

This project, part of the Sensor Fusion Nanodegree, focuses on obstacle detection using Lidar data. The course was taught by [Michael Maile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-maile-ab7a078/), Director of Sensor Fusion & Localization, and [Aaron Brown](https://www.linkedin.com/in/awbrown90/), Senior AV Software Engineer, both from [MBRDNA](https://www.mbrdna.com/) (Mercedes-Benz Research & Development North America, Inc).

The course explored best practices for processing Lidar data, which involved building a pipeline encompassing the following key steps:

1. **Segmentation (RANSAC)**
2. **Clustering (KD-Tree)**
3. **Bounding Boxes**
4. **Filtering and Downsampling (Voxel Grid & Region of Interest)**

The goals of the project is available in the [project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2529/view) webpage.

# Final result.

The `Main Code` is the file [environment.cpp](./src/environment.cpp). To run the simulation follow the next steps in `linux terminal`:

```
* Go to ..src/build
* execute ./environment
```
